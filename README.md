# Jetpack Compose : Unit Converter
An unit converter application developed using material design guidelines with _jetpack compose_ library.

_Unit Conversion_ is the process of calculating different **units** of measurement for the same **quantity**, typically through multiplicative **conversion** factors.

Supports both `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` based on User's preference.

### List of converters:
1. Area
2. Digital Storage
3. Energy
4. Frequency
5. Length
6. Speed
7. Temperature
8. Time
9. Volume
10. Weight
### Note:
* This application uses some of the features, which are still in development phase.
* Will update the project when these features are fully developed/ stable.
* For Example: To add _Animated Visibility_ feature, annotate the composable function with `@ExperimentalAnimationApi`
```kotlin
@ExperimentalAnimationApi
@Composable
fun SampleComposable(){
	AnimatedVisibility(){
		// Your Composable
	}
}
```
